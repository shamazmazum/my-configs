Aleksey Khudyakov's emacs config and my StumpWM config.
The latest one includes following features:

;; Summary:
;; 1) You can build your own program launcher redefining *key-bindings*
;; C-t C-r h is a help on the program launcher
;; C-t C-r m is an interactive launcher menu
;;
;; 2) You can close a window with C-t d and close all windows with C-t ]
;; Also there is "safe quit" command accessible with C-t q
;; It makes stumpwm to quit only if there are no windows left

;; 3) You can set a wallpaper from wallpaper collection via interactive menu
;; with C-t .

;; 4) Path to current wallpaper will be stored in preferences file
;; and the wallpaper will restored in next session

;; WARNING: This configuration file uses *quit-hook*, which is absent in
;; stumpwm distribution(s) and is added to stumpwm by myself.
;; If you want preferences to be stored as stumpwm quits
;; add this patch to stumpwm
